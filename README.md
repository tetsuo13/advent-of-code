Solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

The console application will run all solutions that have puzzle inputs. Save your puzzle input file, named `input.txt`, in the same directory as the `Solution.cs` file for any years and days that you'd like to run. Launch application to dynamically locate all years and days to run that have inputs. Adding or removing `input.txt` files doesn't require rebuilding.

Use Debug configuration to run the solutions for inputs and write the answers to the console. Use Release configuration to run benchmarks for the same solutions.
